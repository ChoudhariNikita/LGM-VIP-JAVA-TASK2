# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java Swing.

## Features

- Play a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against another player.
- User-friendly interface with a grid layout for easy gameplay.
- Tracks and displays the current player's turn and game result (win, draw).
- Allows resetting the game to play again.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-gui.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).

3. Build the project to compile the source code.

4. Run the application, and the Tic-Tac-Toe game will appear on the screen.

## Usage

1. The game starts with Player 1 (typically 'X') making the first move.

2. Click on an empty cell in the grid to place your symbol ('X' or 'O').

3. Alternate turns with the other player until one of the following conditions is met:
   - A player gets three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), resulting in a win.
   - The grid is completely filled without any player achieving a win, resulting in a draw.

4. If the game ends (win or draw), you can click the "Reset" button to start a new game.
