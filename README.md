This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java Swing.

## Features

- Play a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against another player.
- User-friendly interface with a grid layout for easy gameplay.
- Tracks and displays the current player's turn and game result (win, draw).

## Usage

1. The game starts with Player 1 (typically 'X') making the first move.

2. Click on an empty cell in the grid to place your symbol ('X' or 'O').

3. Alternate turns with the other player until one of the following conditions is met:
   - A player gets three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), resulting in a win.
   - The grid is completely filled without any player achieving a win, resulting in a draw.

4. If the game ends (win or draw), you can click the "Reset" button to start a new game.
